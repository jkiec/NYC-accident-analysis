The repository includes my own project analyzing over 200k accidents in NYC from January 2021 to April 2023. 

The goals of the project were:
- creating an interactive report showing how the number of accidents and victims is influenced by various factors, such as location, time or vehicle type,
- compering information about accidents to current weather conditions.

It contains the following parts:
- collection data, cleaning data and load data to a database with Python (Pandas and Meteostat libraries),
- data storage in the MySQL database,
- analyzing and visualization data using Power BI (ETL process by Power Query, calculation using DAX).
